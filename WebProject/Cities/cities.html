    <h1>What is a city?</h1>

    <img class="resize center" src="Images/NewYork.jpg" alt="NY" />

    <p>
      A city can be roughly defined as a densely packed area of people that
      primarily focuses on non-agricultural types of industries. Historically,
      cities were centers of trade, education, and economic opportunity. People
      would flock to cities in search of employment which led to cities such as
      New York, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, etc. becoming extremely populated.
    </p>

    <p>
      Before cars became the standard mode of transportation, cities were made
      with distance in mind. This meant that the places that people wanted or
      needed to go to, were either within walking distance, or had some type of
      public transportation that could take them where they needed to go. This
      changed when cities began to expand and cars rose to prominence.
    </p>

    <p>
      The expansion of cities is often linked with the term "Urban Sprawl",
      which is defined as the expainsion of cities that are poorly planned,
      low-density, and have a lot of distance between homes, stores, work, etc.
      These types of cities also have a somewhat strict separation of commercial
      and residential spaces.
    </p>

    <p>
      A city that perfectly encapsulates the idea of urban sprawl is Houston,
      Texas. Houston is a city that has expanded its metropolitan area
      approximately 65% since 1997 and is home to approximately 2.3 million
      people as of 2020. It is also a city that is known for its amenities such
      as The Galleria and the Johnson Space Center, just as much as it is known
      for its car dependency and terrible traffic.

        <h2>How easy is it to get around Houston?</h2>
        <p>
          Based off the website
          <a href="https://www.walkscore.com/TX/Houston">WalkScore.com</a>,
          Houston has a Walkability Score of 47, a Transit Score of 36, and a
          Bike Score of 49. This means that on average, Houston mostly requires
          a car to get around, has poor public transit, and has minimal bike
          infrastructure. Although this doesn't mean Houston is a "bad" city, it
          does mean that it can be a nightmare for people not traveling in cars.
        </p>

        <h2>How can Houston be improved?</h2>
        <p>
          Luckily, Houston already has plans to make the city a better place for
          people to live in.

            >Houston's Metro System</a
          >
          currently has plans to improve public transit coverage and
          availability in the next 10-15 years which includes the addition of
          light rail, improvements to local bus stops, additional transit
          centers, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>The benefits of a walkable city</h2>
        <p>
            There are many reasons why someone may want to live in a walkable city that range from mental and physical health benefits, to safety benefits in which the area is typically safer when it comes to crime.
