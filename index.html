      This website aims to teach people the ways in which life in cities and
      suburbs can be improved both both for people commuting between the two
      areas, as well as people living within them.

    <p>
      We can improve these things through the implementation of a robust public
      transit system, which includes infrastructure made for public transit use
      only, adoption of pedestrian friendly infrastructure such as refuge
      islands and raised crosswalks, as well as making places more available to
      people without the use of cars.
